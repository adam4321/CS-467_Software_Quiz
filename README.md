## OSU 467 Capstone Group Project

Software Quiz group project for Oregon State University. It is
intended to replace Survey Monkey as a tool to email quizzes to
job applicants.

It can be run by cloning the project and then setting up the
necessary Google Oauth2 credentials in the GCP dashboard and
adding those credentials in a file called GOOGLE-credentials.js.

Then just npm install and node app.js!
